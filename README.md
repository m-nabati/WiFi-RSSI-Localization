# Wi-Fi RSSI Dataset for Fingerprint-based Localization

This dataset can be used for fingerprint-based localization, and contains 250 locations. 27 Wi-Fi access points have been detected in the test environment and the ```RSS``` values have been recorded at those locations. Each file in the ```RSS``` folder corresponds to a file in ```xyz``` folder. The ```xyz``` folder shows the coordinates where the z value is set to zero because we measured the ```RSS``` values at a fixed height.
